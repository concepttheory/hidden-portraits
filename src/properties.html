                            The Hidden Portraits deal with paintings from other
                            epochs, which had a completely different set of
                            values than we have today. These include the
                            unchallenged supremacy of men.

                          <p>
                            Portraits of men are mainly an expression of wealth

                            the male portraits breathe the self-assured attitude
                            that the Hidden Portraits frame and satirize in many
                            ways.

                            In portraits of women over the centuries, one
                            notices the basic decorative mood in which they were
                            created. As time passed there were gradual
                            improvements. Women were eventually depicted with
                            insignias of power (by marriage), or if they were
                            considered intelligent, they might hold books in
                            their hands.

                            However self-confident, wealthy or smart, their role
                            in society was secondary to that of men. Often the
                            view of women was reduced to a showcase of beauty.

                            The historical portraits that serve as the basis of
                            Hidden Portraits are painted reality on two
                            dimensions. Paint and brushstrokes depict skin,
                            body, clothing, and space so that we recognize them
                            as real. The Hidden Portraits modify this painted
                            reality and pay careful attention to the
                            idiosyncrasies of the painters. Each of these
                            magnificent artists had unique characteristics and
                            individual skills, making this amazing art still
                            impressive to this day.

                          <p>
                            If a historic sculpture is the basis of a Hidden
                            Portrait, the starting point is very different. In
                            this case, I am modifying a photograph of a real,
                            three-dimensional object, and unlike paintings, our
                            eyes can register the smallest errors. Sculptures
                            create great technical challenges for me because the
                            collage should be plausible and comprehensible.

                            A characteristic feature of drawings is not only the
                            line drawn but rather the lines not drawn. A line
                            can show an outline of a face, the surface we
                            complete in our imagination (because actually, it is
                            the blank sheet of paper). This is particularly
                            challenging for the Hidden Portraits, which must
                            work with these specific elements of drawings.

                            elite and only very briefly. Because sometimes one's
                            own hair was not full enough, huge powdered and
                            ceremonial wigs were invented to display power and
                            station. As part of the head, they are elementary
                            for the Hidden Portraits. They refer to past
                            fashions and social codes, of which we no longer
                            have any clue.

                          <p>
                            Flowers are, of course, a beautiful accessory in
                            portraits. Real or fabric flowers were often worn by
                            women as part of clothing. The hidden portraits
                            frequently use flowers to exaggerate notions of
                            beauty or to draw attention to the role of women in
                            previous periods. But beyond that, there are many
                            established codes of what flowers represent in
                            paintings. They are important metaphors for the
                            interpretation of portraits and an essential
                            component of Hidden Portraits.

                          <p>
                            Jewels are rare, precious, and technically difficult
                            to work with. In sum, the perfect tool for
                            representation to this day. For painters they were
                            always a challenge because of their shiny surface
                            and partial transparency. In Hidden Portraits,
                            jewels are an important means of exaggeration. A
                            duplication of jewels in the Hidden Portraits is a
                            well-functioning metaphor for an important rank,
                            decadence, or vanity.

                          <p>
                            Lace is the goddess among fabrics. Lace has always
                            attracted people -its transparency, delicate nature
                            and difficulty to manufacture have made it a fabric
                            of the elite. It appears in many portraits as a sign
                            of wealth and is important for the Hidden Portraits
                            because it can cover a face and yet allows a
                            mysterious glimpse of the gaze.

                          <p>
                            From shimmering silk and complex brocades to
                            elaborate trimmings, human creativity has focussed
                            on the design and decoration of precious fabrics.
                            For the painters of portraits, it has always been a
                            technical challenge to depict the texture of the
                            fabric in such a way that their preciousness is
                            apparent to the viewer. The Hidden Portraits use
                            these fabrics specifically for veiling, pointing out
                            that sometimes fabrics that seem normal to us today
                            were the height of decadence in earlier times.

                          <p>
                            Ribbons and bows are typical mechanisms to make a
                            garment look even more complex. There were instances
                            when an elite sitter was adorned with more than a
                            few ribbons. The painters must have gone mad
                            painting all these small details. For the Hidden
                            Portraits, ribbons are an important instrument of
                            expressing movement. Wrapped widely around the body,
                            they make many a stiff portrait swing.

                          <p>
                            What began as a small frill at the neckline evolved
                            into an independent circular collar that could reach
                            enormous proportions. The larger the ruff, the more
                            important the wearer. Located close to the face the
                            ruff is of enormous importance in the Hidden
                            Portraits. Hardly any other fashion accessory can be
                            duplicated in such an absurd yet comprehensible way

                            The suits of armor we know from many portraits are
                            mostly decorative and ceremonial. Technically they
                            are functional, but mostly they were used to show
                            power and importance through fine craftsmanship.
                            Worn exclusively by men, they are well qualified to
                            make statements about a masculine self-image and
                            attitude in the Hidden Portraits.

                            Anything hard to acquire becomes expensive,
                            exclusive, and desired by the wealthy. During
                            certain periods only noble people were allowed to
                            wear fur at all. What a sign of rank! The hidden
                            portraits always like to use furs for covering.
                            Since it is a natural material, it becomes a
                            particularly effective alienation.

                            It starts with the crazy final phase of the baroque,
                            the Rococo, where everyone goes crazy once again.
                            Then the art develops into classicism, again the
                            ancient world is used as a model. Rationality and a
                            more romantic relationship with nature emerge, until
